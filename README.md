This project was made for a class assignment. It is meant to copy a certain layout exactly. However the contents within the layout were open to artistic license. As such it represents a job posting page with a few changes for entertainment's sake. The images are a little different as this part was not the focus of the project. The color combination was taken from a color pallette site. The site has also been adjusted to be responsive and conform to various screen sizes.
